- local env as today
- preview env should point to production with beta tag (https://mzxfialk.api.sanity.io/v1/graphql/production/beta), make graphql deploy with ci?
- production env should work as today, make graphql deploy with ci (if schema change is made) when merge to master, also deploy sanity studio

- Don't deploy before tests & deploy's are ok
